NOTIFY 8.x MODULE README
------------------------

This is a simple notification module. It provides e-mail notifications to
members about updates and changes to the Drupal web site.

Send comments via the issues queue on drupal.org:
http://drupal.org/project/issues/notify

------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

This module requires a supported version of Drupal and cron to be
running.

------------------------
INSTALLATION
------------------------

1. Extract the notify module directory, including all its
   subdirectories, into directory where you keep contributed modules
   (e.g. /modules/).

2. Enable the notify module on the Modules list page.  The database
   tables will be created automagically for you at this point.

3. Modify permissions on the People >> Permissions page.

   To set the notification checkbox default on new user registration
   form, or let new users opt in for notifications during
   registration, you must grant the anonymous user the right to access
   notify.

4. Configure general notification settings.  See the "Usage" section
   below for details.

------------------------
USAGE
------------------------

The administrative interface is at: Administer >> Configuration >>
People >> Notify.  The Settings tab is for setting how
often notifications are sent, and for selecting notification by note
type.  The Users tab is to review and see per-user settings.

When setting how often notifications are sent, note that e-mail
updates can only happen as frequently as the cron is set to run.
Check your cron settings.

If you enable node revisions (http://drupal.org/node/320614), the
notification e-mail will also mention the name of the last person to
edit the node.

To manage your own notification preferences, click on the
"Notification settings" on your "My account" page.
